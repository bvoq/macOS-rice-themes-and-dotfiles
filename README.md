Here are my XCode/(n)vim/terminal themes and configurations, hope you like them!

Check out install.sh and see what it does.
You may want to enable/disable some options in .macos

After running it you can open vim (or nvim, whichever you prefer) and run :PlugInstall to install themes and plugins for vim/nvim.

I've added useful vimrc and tmux templates with the same theme.
