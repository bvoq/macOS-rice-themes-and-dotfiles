# macOS-rice-themes-and-dotfiles
Here are my macOS/XCode/(n)vim/terminal configurations and themes, hope you like them!

I recommend copying and pasting snippets you like from this repo and host your own dotfiles.

If you are on macOS/unix check out `bootstrap.zsh`

If you are on Windows check out `bootstrap.ps1`

Install using:
```
zsh bootstrap.zsh
```
