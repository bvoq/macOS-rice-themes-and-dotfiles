Add the Zenburn.xccolortheme to 
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/

If this folder doesn't exist create it.

Go to Preferences > Fonts & Colors to enable the theme after relaunching Xcode.

Then additionally I use a font with ligatures, like [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for example.
